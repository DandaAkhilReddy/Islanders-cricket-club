## üîê Authentication Flow (Working!)

1. User visits `/login`
2. Clicks "Continue with Google"
3. Google popup opens
4. User selects Google account
5. Firebase Auth creates/updates user
6. `userService` creates user document in Firestore with roles
7. `akhilreddydanda3@gmail.com` gets `isAdmin: true`
8. Others get `isPlayer: true`
9. Redirect to `/profile` page
10. User can fill out/edit profile
11. Profile saves to Firestore `players/{uid}`
12. Equipment tracking works
13. Admin can access `/admin` dashboard
14. Regular users redirected from admin routes
