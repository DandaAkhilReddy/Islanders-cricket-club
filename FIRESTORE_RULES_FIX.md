2. ✅ Firebase Auth succeeded
3. ✅ User was created in Auth
4. ❌ Firestore rules are blocking database access

---

## ⚡ Quick Fix (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Firestore Rules Editor

**Direct Link:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/islanderscricketclub/firestore/rules

Or manually:
1. Firebase Console → **islanderscricketclub** project
2. Left sidebar → **Firestore Database**
3. Top tab → **Rules**

---

### Step 2: Replace ALL Rules

You'll see existing rules (probably very restrictive). **Delete everything** and replace with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Users collection - users can read/write their own document
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Players collection - authenticated users can read, admins can write
    match /players/{playerId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Matches collection - public read for live scores, authenticated write
    match /matches/{matchId} {
      allow read: if true; // Public can view live matches
      allow write: if request.auth != null;

      // Live match data subcollection
      match /live/{document=**} {
        allow read: if true; // Public can view live scores
        allow write: if request.auth != null;
      }
    }

    // Practices collection
    match /practices/{practiceId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Equipment collection
    match /equipment/{equipmentId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Expenses collection
    match /expenses/{expenseId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Announcements collection
    match /announcements/{announcementId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Messages collection
    match /messages/{messageId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Profiles collection (for multi-profile system)
    match /profiles/{profileId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null &&
                     (resource == null || resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid);
    }

    // Default: deny all other access
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Publish Rules

1. Click the **"Publish"** button (top-right)
2. Confirm the changes
3. Wait for "Rules published successfully" message

---

### Step 4: Test Login

1. **Reload the login page** (F5)
2. **Click "Continue with Google"** again
3. **Should now redirect to `/profile` successfully!** ✅

## 🔒 What These Rules Do

### Security Features:

**Users Collection:**
- ✅ Users can only access their own user document
- ✅ Prevents users from seeing other users' data

**Players Collection:**
- ✅ Any authenticated user can view players
- ✅ Any authenticated user can update (for now)
- 🔧 Later: Restrict to admin-only writes

**Matches Collection:**
- ✅ **PUBLIC** read access (anyone can view live scores)
- ✅ Only authenticated users can create/edit matches
- ✅ Perfect for live score viewing by spectators

**Other Collections:**
- ✅ Require authentication to read/write
- ✅ Protects sensitive data (equipment, budget, etc.)

## 🧪 Testing After Rules Update

### Test 1: Login
1. Go to: https://cricket-team-management-cotaa1d9h.vercel.app/login
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. **Expected:** Redirect to `/profile` with no errors ✅

### Test 2: Profile Page
1. Should see your Google account info
2. Should see profile form/interface
3. **Expected:** No "permission denied" errors ✅

### Test 3: Admin Panel
1. Navigate to: https://cricket-team-management-cotaa1d9h.vercel.app/admin
2. **Expected:** Admin dashboard loads ✅
3. Should see stats, quick actions

### Test 4: Console Verification
1. Press F12 → Console
2. Should see:
   ```javascript
   Firebase: Successfully signed in
   User loaded: {uid: "...", email: "akhilreddydanda3@gmail.com"}
   ```
3. **No permission errors** ✅

## 🐛 If You Still See Permission Errors

### Check 1: Rules Published Correctly

1. Go to Firestore Rules page
2. Verify you see the new rules
3. Check timestamp shows recent publish time

### Check 2: Firestore Database Exists

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/islanderscricketclub/firestore
2. Click "Data" tab
3. You should see collections starting to appear
4. If you see "Create database" → Click it and create in production mode

### Check 3: Clear Cache and Retry

1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Fresh incognito window
3. Login again

## 📊 Current Rules vs New Rules

### Before (Probably):
```javascript
// Default restrictive rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false; // Deny all
    }
  }
}
```
**Result:** Everything blocked ❌

### After (New):
```javascript
// Authenticated user access
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null; // Allow authenticated
    }
  }
}
```
**Result:** Authenticated users can access data ✅

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Current Setup:
- ✅ Requires authentication for most operations
- ✅ Users can only access their own user document
- ✅ Public can view live matches (good for spectators!)
- ⚠️ Any authenticated user can write to most collections

### Future Improvements (Phase 3):

You'll want to add role-based rules like:

```javascript
// Check if user is admin
function isAdmin() {
  return request.auth != null &&
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.roles.isAdmin == true;
}

// Then use it:
match /players/{playerId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if isAdmin(); // Only admins can edit players
}
```

But for now, the basic authenticated rules will work!
