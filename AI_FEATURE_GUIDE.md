## 🧠 How AI Analysis Works

### 1. Image Upload
- Player selects scorecard images
- Images converted to base64 format
- Validated (must be image files)

### 2. AI Processing
- Each image sent to Gemini AI
- AI prompt instructs: "Extract ALL player stats from this scorecard"
- Looks for:
  - Batting scorecards (runs, balls, 4s, 6s)
  - Bowling scorecards (overs, wickets, economy)
  - Fielding stats (catches, stumpings)
  - Match details (teams, date, venue)

### 3. Data Extraction
- AI returns structured JSON with:
  - Player names
  - All statistics
  - Confidence score (0-100%)
  - Match information

### 4. Aggregation
- Stats from multiple images combined
- Same player across different matches aggregated
- Totals calculated (runs, wickets, catches)
- Averages computed (batting average, strike rate)

### 5. Display
- Beautiful cards for each player
- Color-coded stats (green=runs, red=wickets, blue=catches)
- Confidence indicators
- Export options
